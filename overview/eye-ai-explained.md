# Eye AI - Explained

In simpler terms, AI which stands for artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. AI manifests itself in a variety of ways. Some examples are:

* **`Chatbots use AI to understand customer problems faster and provide more efficient responses`**
* **`Intelligent assistants use AI to analyze critical information from large free-text datasets to improve programming`**
* **`Recommendation engines can provide automated recommendations for TV shows based on users' viewing habits`**

AI is more related to process and superpowered thinking skills and data analysis than to any particular format or function. Although AI brings images of robots resembling the high-functioning men who rule the world, AI is not intended to replace humans. Its goal is to significantly enhance human abilities and contributions. This makes it a very valuable business asset.
