# ðŸ§¿ Point to ETH network

_A bridge or interchain bridge is a service (centralized or decentralized) that allows you to create a connection between two blockchains that cannot normally communicate with each other, so that tokens can be transferred between them._

_This is a utility that has become essential thanks to the arrival of DeFi services, which have taken the crypto community a big leap in the use of blockchain technology and the tokens that make life on the different blockchains capable of providing this type of service._

#### _How does a bridge work?_

_A bridge can be thought of as a simple information exchanger between blockchains. In other words, the main function of a bridge is to allow the bidirectional exchange of information between blockchain A and blockchain B, through a protocol that allows this connection. Of course this is an easy way to see how a bridge works, but the basic idea is this, and having this very clear will help you understand exactly how this exchange of information happens._

_**In fact, we can summarize it in four steps:**_

* _The bridge is located between the A and B chain, creating the basic structure for it to function._
* _If you want to pass a token From A > B, you go to the bridge, indicate the number of tokens you want to exchange at A, and provide the destination address at B._
* _You make the shipment in A and the bridge locks that balance in a vault, and then in B the exact amount of tokens is minted and sent to the address in B that you provided._
* _The tokens in A are blocked as collateral for the tokens in B and you can only get them back by doing the reverse process._

#### EYE-AI and its bridge

_We will have a bridge that allows transactions between two networks eth and bsc._
