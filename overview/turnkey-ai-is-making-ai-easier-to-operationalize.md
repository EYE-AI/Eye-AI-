# ðŸ§¿ Turnkey AI is making AI easier to operationalize

_Turnkey AI is making AI easier to operationalize The emergence of solutions and tools with AI technology means that more companies can take advantage of AI at a lower cost and in less time. Out-of-the-box AI refers to solutions, tools, and software that have built-in AI capabilities or automate the algorithmic decision-making process._

_Turnkey AI can be anything from standalone databases that automatically retrieve themselves using machine learning, to pre-built models that can be applied to a variety of datasets to solve challenges such as image recognition and text analysis. It can help companies achieve faster time to value, increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve customer relationships._
