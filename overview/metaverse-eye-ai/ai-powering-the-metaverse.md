# ðŸ§¿ AI powering the Metaverse

#### _AI powering the Metaverse_&#x20;

_Artificial intelligence is one of the pillars on which the metaverse is being built. Starting with processing user-generated data, continuing with generative AI models that create photorealistic virtual environments and avatars that resemble users, and the ability to recognize body movements and thus make the metaverse experience more natural._

_But AI will also breathe new life into the digital characters that populate virtual worlds, such as non-human characters and personal assistants, and allow everyone to understand each other in their own language by simultaneously translating speech._

#### _Integration of the Metaverse with Eye-AI_

_Artificial intelligence will provide fundamental support for the metaverse, simplifying people's access to digital environments, as well as aiding in content generation and the interaction between humans and virtual worlds. Here are some of the points we will address:_

_For the metaverse to exist, servers and network systems need to be up and running. As companies that host MMORPGs (such as World of Warcraft or Elder Scrolls Online) are well aware, running an infrastructure that can simultaneously host over half a million users every day requires titanic efforts in terms of computing resources._

_This is precisely why Meta recently unveiled the AI Research SuperCluster (RSC), one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world. As the company states, one of the tasks of the supercomputer will be to take care of the metaverse, that is, to keep digital worlds running and host the activities of millions of users, even simultaneously, without slowdowns or resource problems._

_Artificial intelligence will also be used to scan and process in real time the enormous amount of data produced every second by the users' activities in the <mark style="background-color:blue;">**EYE-AI**</mark> metaverse to enable other situations_
