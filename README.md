# ðŸ§¿ Eye AI - Explained

_Eye Ai's main goal is the integration of artificial intelligence in human activities and business situations, where we notice a great need for highly autonomous systems, which operate without the need for stops and maintain standardization throughout the process._

#### _AI Bot Free Telegram_

_Eye Ai is a free-to-use telegram bot that provides users access to ChatGTP and DALL-E via chat commands._

#### _AI Development_

_Eye AI we are very supportive of the creation, 1% of the EYE-AI BEP20 token will be donated to AI related institutions that will be selected by the community in voting_

#### _**About Eye AI**_

Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

* _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Image generation.**</mark>_
* _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Fine-tuning**</mark>_

#### _Metaverse integration with EYE-AI_

_The metaverse is here to stay, it is just being born and there is a lot to be done for the best use of all, either by the companies that are involved in the projects, or by the brands that are promoting and selling products and services in this new digital media channel, or with users learning, playing, having fun, and even working in this new environment. And artificial intelligence is a fundamental pillar to support all of this, along with digital security and other technologies._

_Some of the concepts applied in EYE-AI are:_

* _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Moderating and identifying harmful behavior;**</mark>_
* _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Facilitating simultaneous translations;**</mark>_
* _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Allowing you to make your own avatar;**</mark>_

#### _Cryptocurrency trading robots_

_Investment robots are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven financial services with almost no human supervision. They are widely used in day trading to increase the efficiency of trading in the stock market._\
_Through protocols and algorithms, we will bring our investors a cryptocurrency trading robot, where through data, it will design everyone the best conditions statistically._

#### _Trend Tracking_

_We at Eye-AI, by means of artificial intelligence, are developing a boot, which will indicate the best options for entries, where they can be put in Telegram groups to indicate trending projects, with it a brief description of the whole project under analysis._

#### _EYE-AI integration with institutions_

_Through research we can punctuate some places of IA performance, where it generates great return to the institutions and, consequently, to humanity, such as:_

1. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Detect and prevent security intrusions**</mark>_
2. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Solve users' technology problems**</mark>_
3. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Reduce production management work**</mark>_
4. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Evaluate internal compliance when using approved suppliers**</mark>_

#### _<mark style="background-color:blue;">But before we delve deeper, let's bring up two short historical concepts of IA success...</mark>_

_AI is the determining factor behind some significant success stories:_

* _the Associated Press produced 12 times more stories by training AI software to automatically write short news stories about earnings. This effort freed its journalists to write more detailed texts._
* _Deep Patient, an artificial intelligence tool created by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, allows doctors to identify high-risk patients before diseases are even diagnosed. The tool analyzes a patient's medical history to predict nearly 80 diseases up to a year before onset._

## _Eye AI's Current Intentions_

#### _<mark style="background-color:blue;">Turnkey AI is making AI easier to operationalize</mark>_

_The emergence of solutions and tools with AI technology means that more companies can take advantage of AI at a lower cost and in less time. Out-of-the-box AI refers to solutions, tools, and software that have built-in AI capabilities or automate the algorithmic decision-making process._&#x20;

_Turnkey AI can be anything from standalone databases that automatically retrieve themselves using machine learning, to pre-built models that can be applied to a variety of datasets to solve challenges such as image recognition and text analysis. It can help companies achieve faster time to value, increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve customer relationships._

## _Eye AI's Future Intentions_

#### _<mark style="background-color:blue;">From artificial intelligence to adaptive intelligence</mark>_

_As AI capabilities reach traditional business operations, a new term is evolving: adaptive intelligence. Adaptive intelligence applications help enterprises make better business decisions by combining the power of real-time internal and external data with highly scalable compute and decision science infrastructure._

_These applications essentially make your business smarter. This enables you to provide your customers with better products, recommendations, and services, all of which bring better business results._
