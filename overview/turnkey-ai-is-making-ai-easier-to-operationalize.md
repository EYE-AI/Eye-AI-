# Turnkey AI is making AI easier to operationalize

Turnkey AI is making AI easier to operationalize The emergence of solutions and tools with AI technology means that more companies can take advantage of AI at a lower cost and in less time. Out-of-the-box AI refers to solutions, tools, and software that have built-in AI capabilities or automate the algorithmic decision-making process.

Turnkey AI can be anything from standalone databases that automatically retrieve themselves using machine learning, to pre-built models that can be applied to a variety of datasets to solve challenges such as image recognition and text analysis. It can help companies achieve faster time to value, increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve customer relationships.
