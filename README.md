# ðŸ§¿ Eye AI - Explained

_Eye Ai's main goal is the integration of artificial intelligence in human activities and business situations, where we notice a great need for highly autonomous systems, which operate without the need for stops and maintain standardization throughout the process._

#### _AI Bot Free Telegram_

_Eye Ai is a free-to-use telegram bot that provides users access to ChatGTP and DALL-E via chat commands._

#### _AI Development_

_Eye AI we are very supportive of the creation, 1% of the EYE-AI BEP20 token will be donated to AI related institutions that will be selected by the community in voting_

#### _**About Eye AI**_

Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

_Through research we can punctuate some places of IA performance, where it generates great return to the institutions and, consequently, to humanity, such as:_

1. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Detect and prevent security intrusions**</mark>_
2. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Solve users' technology problems**</mark>_
3. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Reduce production management work**</mark>_
4. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Evaluate internal compliance when using approved suppliers**</mark>_

#### _<mark style="background-color:blue;">But before we delve deeper, let's bring up two short historical concepts of IA success...</mark>_

_AI is the determining factor behind some significant success stories:_

* _the Associated Press produced 12 times more stories by training AI software to automatically write short news stories about earnings. This effort freed its journalists to write more detailed texts._
* _Deep Patient, an artificial intelligence tool created by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, allows doctors to identify high-risk patients before diseases are even diagnosed. The tool analyzes a patient's medical history to predict nearly 80 diseases up to a year before onset._

## _Eye AI's Current Intentions_

#### _<mark style="background-color:blue;">Turnkey AI is making AI easier to operationalize</mark>_

_The emergence of solutions and tools with AI technology means that more companies can take advantage of AI at a lower cost and in less time. Out-of-the-box AI refers to solutions, tools, and software that have built-in AI capabilities or automate the algorithmic decision-making process._&#x20;

_Turnkey AI can be anything from standalone databases that automatically retrieve themselves using machine learning, to pre-built models that can be applied to a variety of datasets to solve challenges such as image recognition and text analysis. It can help companies achieve faster time to value, increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve customer relationships._

## _Eye AI's Future Intentions_

#### _<mark style="background-color:blue;">From artificial intelligence to adaptive intelligence</mark>_

_As AI capabilities reach traditional business operations, a new term is evolving: adaptive intelligence. Adaptive intelligence applications help enterprises make better business decisions by combining the power of real-time internal and external data with highly scalable compute and decision science infrastructure._

_These applications essentially make your business smarter. This enables you to provide your customers with better products, recommendations, and services, all of which bring better business results._
