# ðŸ§¿ What is driving AI adoption?

#### Three factors are driving the development of AI in all sectors:

1. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Affordable, high-performance computing power is readily available.**</mark> The abundance of commodity computing power in the cloud allows easy access to affordable, high-performance computing power. Prior to this development, the only computing environments available for AI were not cloud-based and were cost prohibitive._
2. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Large volumes of data are available for training.**</mark> AI needs to be trained on a lot of data to make the right predictions. The emergence of different tools to label data, plus the ease and accessibility with which organizations can store and process structured and unstructured data, is enabling more organizations to create and train AI algorithms._
3. _<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Applied AI offers a competitive advantage.**</mark> Companies are increasingly recognizing the competitive advantage of applying AI information to business objectives and are making it a business-wide priority.
