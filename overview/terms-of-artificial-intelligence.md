# Terms of Artificial Intelligence

AI has become a generic term for applications that perform complex tasks that previously required information from the user, such as communicating with customers online or a game of chess. The term is often used interchangeably with its subfields, which include machine learning and deep learning. However, there are differences. For example, machine learning is focused on creating systems that learn or improve their performance based on the data they consume. It is important to note that while all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning.

To get the full value of AI, many companies are making significant investments in data science teams. Data science, an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific and other methods to extract value from data, combines skills from fields such as statistics and computer science with business knowledge to analyze data collected from a variety of sources.
